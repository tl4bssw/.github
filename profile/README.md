## Team Learning for Better Scientific Software

Interdisciplinary group work in scientific software development is increasingly common as institutional initiatives aim to advance science through collaboration and technological innovation. These collaborations are created with the goal of solving problems that are complex in nature and benefit from the integration of varied forms of expertise and perspectives to produce software. Team learning has been identified as a key process for the performance and collaboration effectiveness of scientific teams. At the same time, facilitating this form of learning remains a challenge given the breadth of expertise that must be synthesized to effectively build knowledge.

A 2-day workshop was organized to bring together experts across disciplines and domains. Our goal is to develop and maintain an open knowledge base with tools to support and evaluate team learning in the interdisciplinary groups who produce scientific software. We aim to contribute to understanding of collaborative learning in scientific software development and use. A summary of the workshop and resources for teams are provided on [our website](https://tl4bssw.github.io).
